# testDrivenScoreKeeper
The goal of this TDD kata is to create a class that keeps track of the score during a basket ball game.
I am to create a class called ScoreKeeper and define this class with a contructor and seven member funcitons. Those member functions are: 
scoreTeamA1
scoreTeamA2
scoreTeamA3
scoreTeamB1
scoreTeamB2
scoreTeamB3
getScore

The score is supposed to represented as a 7-length string, three spots dedicated to team A, three spots dedicated to team B, and one spot reserved for a ":"

These instructions can be found on https://kata-log.rocks/score-keeper-kata
